# myBudgetPlanner
This project was born our of my personal experience with budgeting.
I found out that the best way to budget is by constantly monitoring 
what you spend by manually inputing your expenses in the budget. 

In order to use this software, I divide my expenses into the following categories:
- **Fixed expenses:** rent, utilities, transportation costs, insurance, communication.
- **Month miscellaneous:** only applicable for this month, maybe a quick getaway, mechanic, house work, etc.
- **Flexible expenses:** these are expenses that you can control; groceries, eating out, gifts, entertainment.

The goal of this software is to minimize your flexible expenses, by allocating funds into these
categories, in that way we can maximize the **savings** category.

## Monthly Budget
The monthly budget class will help you budget your income, fixed expenses
and allocate the money into the flexible categories.
